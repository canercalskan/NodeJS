<h1>Node.JS REST API (CRUD) </h1>
<p>Run "<i>npm start</i>" via terminal, server will start listening port 4200 on your localhost </p>
<p>Check routes under the routes folder, the root route is "<i>/api</i> "</p>
<p>-> Since there is no database connection -yet-, this api uses an array variable as storage. All operations and datas will be lost after restarting the server</p>
